    I dove into the cloud, hunted down maps, opened up whole secret worlds. Getting off that fluffy cloud and scratching the surface of these smooth machines. The clouds faded as we climbed, revealing a quilt of farmland. The cloud takes us into its precursors.</p><p>
    At the other end of the spec&shy;trum are the cloud natives. The cloud is embodied in thousands. All around us a susurration, like the rustling of insects in tall dry grass: a cloud of whispers.</p>
    <p>Welcome to the age of cloud native. We invest the cloud with cultural fantasies. You exist in the cloud more and you will start to understand the cloud more. Put&shy;ting all your faith in the cloud means you're also putting all your faith in continued, unfettered ac&shy;cess. Believe in cloud-first or cloud-only.</p><p>
    A move towards clouds signals a fundamental shift. Look at a second phase of migration to the cloud when it starts moving. Hy&shy;brid cloud will be the first step for a secure journey in the cloud and will be the route of choice. Trans&shy;formation is taking hold across the globe, with cloud serving as the key driver. Typically cloud platforms are the endpoints.</p><p>
    Moving to the cloud lowers capital expenditure. Researchers found a positive correlation between cloud use and financial gain. Cloud integration moves to the fore.

    You will be told by executive management to move to the cloud. Move everything to the cloud haphazardly. Reap the cloud’s rewards and stay ahead of competitors.</p><p>
    With cloud adoption, the meter keeps running, costs keep piling up, and executives often receive nasty surprises. Like the inaudible hum of the electrical grid at 60 hertz, the cloud is silent, in the background, and almost unnotice&shy;able. The cloud is a diffuse and invisible structure of power. Per&shy;haps the most surprising thing about the cloud is how old it is.</p><p>
    A cannonball explodes through a regiment of soldiers, sending up clouds of broken limbs. This de&shy;luge of hybrid clouds. The cloud unexpectedly decelerates as it ap&shy;proaches and comes to rest around the Sun. The cloud is dead, long live the cloud.</p><p>
    Tomorrow's clouds are form&shy;ing. Expect to see a new breed of cloud. By most accounts, the cloud is expected to blossom. The new cloud era—Cloud 2.0—in&shy;volves a tightly integrated hybrid environment.</p><p>
    We’ve spent a long time turn&shy;ing the cloud into something spe&shy;cial. We could immediately see that the power of the cloud would enable. Nothing works better than a cloud. The cloud is just too good. The cloud is here and it’s moving toward something.</p><p>
